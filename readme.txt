HK Angular class gets into Client-Server in Week-4
and the first exercise had us installing a json-server
as well as setting up a 'gulp' file that creates a
'distribution' ... that is good to go.

don't want to lose the steps taken ... may be
modifying it or disgarding for something else
in a later exercise.

And this process is/was helpful and good.
